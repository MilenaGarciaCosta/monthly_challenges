## :calendar: Monthly challenges
This project was created to practice core Django concepts, including views, templates, and dynamic routing.
The system displays a list of months, allowing users to select a specific month and receive a random challenge to complete during that time.

## :wrench: How to run
After cloning the repository, run the following command
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  or
  python3 manage.py runserver
```
When you open the development server, add ```/challenge/``` to the url. That's the starting point of the project.
Example:
```bash
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/challenge/
```
Now you should get a list of months and be able to interact with them.
